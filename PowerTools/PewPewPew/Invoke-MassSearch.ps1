    Functions to run query the search indexer on a mass number 
    of machines without using PSRemoting.

    Thanks to @obscuresec for the initial idea.

    Utilizes an adatation of @obscuresec's quick webserver stub:

function Invoke-MassSearch {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Runs Get-IndexedItem across multiple machines in order
        to search for specific terms from the windows search
        indexer. The output is saved directly back to
        the launching machine through the same webserver, parsed and
        then returned on the pipeline.

function Get-IndexedItem {
    <#
       .SYNOPSIS
            Gets files which have been indexed by Windows desktop search
       .Description
            Searches the Windows index on the local computer or a remote file serving computer
            Looking for file properties or free text searching over contents       
        .PARAMETER Filter
            Alias WHERE, INCLUDE
            A single string containing a WHERE condition, or multiple conditions linked with AND
            or Multiple strings each with a single Condition, which will be joined together.
            The function tries to add Prefixes and single quotes if they are omitted
            If no =, >,< , Like or Contains is specified the terms will be used in a freeText contains search
            Syntax Information for CONTAINS and FREETEXT can be found at 
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd626247(v=office.11).aspx
        .PARAMETER OrderBy
            Alias SORT
            Either a single string containing one or more Order BY conditions, 
            or multiple string each with a single condition which will be joined together            
        .PARAMETER Path
            A single string containing a path which should be searched. 
            This may be a UNC path to a share on a remote computer 
        .PARAMETER First
            Alias TOP
            A single integer representing the number of items to be returned. 
        .PARAMETER Value
            Alias GROUP
            A single string containing a Field name. 
            If specified the search will return the Values in this field, instead of objects
            for the items found by the query terms. 
        .PARAMETER Recurse
            If Path is specified only a single folder is searched Unless -Recurse is specified
            If path is not specified the whole index is searched, and recurse is ignored. 
        .PARAMETER List
            Instead of querying the index produces a list of known field names, with short names and aliases
            which may be used instead.
        .PARAMETER NoFiles
            Normally if files are found the command returns a file object with additional properties,
            which can be piped into commands which accept files. This switch prevents the file being fetched
            improving performance when the file object is not needed. 
        .PARAMETER Terms
            Multiple terms to search for in given files
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-IndexedItem -Filter "Contains(*,'Stingray')", "kind = 'picture'", "keywords='portfolio'" 
            Finds picture files anywhere on the local machine, which have 'Portfolio' as a keyword tag,
            and 'stringray' in any indexed property.
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-IndexedItem Stingray, kind=picture, keyword=portfolio | copy -destination e:\
            Finds the same pictures as the previous example but uses Keyword as a alias for KeywordS, and
            leaves the ' marks round Portfolio and Contains() round stingray to be automatically inserted  
            Copies the found files to drive E: 
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-IndexedItem -filter stingray -path OneIndex14:// -recurse    
            Finds OneNote items containing "Stingray" (note, nothing will be found without -recurse) 
        .EXAMPLE
            start (Get-IndexedItem -filter stingray -path OneIndex14:// -recurse -first 1 -orderby rank)
            Finds the highest ranked one not page for stingray and opens it. 
            Note Start-process (canonical name for Start) does not support piped input. 
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-IndexedItem -filter stingray -path ([system.environment]::GetFolderPath( [system.environment+specialFolder]::MyPictures )) -recurse    
            Looks for pictures with stingray in any indexed property, limiting the scope of the search 
            to the current users 'My Pictures' folder and its subfolders.
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-IndexedItem -Filter "system.kind = 'recordedTV' " -order "System.RecordedTV.RecordingTime" -path "\\atom-engine\users" -recurse | format-list path,title,episodeName,programDescription
            Finds recorded TV files on a remote server named 'Atom-Engine' which are accessible via a share named 'users'. 
            Field name prefixes are specified explicitly instead of letting the function add them
            Results are displayed as a list using a subset of the available fields specific to recorded TV
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-IndexedItem -Value "kind" -path \\atom-engine\users  -recurse
            Lists the kinds of files available on the on the 'users' share of a remote server named 'Atom-Engine'
        .EXAMPLE    
            Get-IndexedItem -Value "title" -filter "kind=recordedtv" -path \\atom-engine\users  -recurse
            Lists the titles of RecordedTv files available on the on the 'users' share of a remote server named 'Atom-Engine'
        .EXAMPLE
           Start (Get-IndexedItem -path "\\atom-engine\users" -recurse -Filter "title= 'Formula 1' " -order "System.RecordedTV.RecordingTime DESC" -top 1 )    
           Finds files entitled "Formula 1" on the 'users' share of a remote server named 'Atom-Engine'
           Selects the most recent one by TV recording date, and opens it on the local computer. 
           Note: start does not support piped input. 
        .EXAMPLE
           Get-IndexedItem -Filter "System.Kind = 'Music' AND AlbumArtist like '%'  " | Group-Object -NoElement -Property "AlbumArtist" | sort -Descending -property count
           Gets all music files with an Album Artist set, using a single combined where condition and a mixture 
           of implicit and explicit field prefixes.  
           The result is grouped by Artist and sorted to give popular artist first
        .EXAMPLE
               Get-IndexedItem "itemtype='.mp3'","AlbumArtist like '%'","RatingText <> '1 star'" -NoFiles -orderby encodingBitrate,size | ft -a AlbumArtist, 
               Title, @{n="size"; e={($_.size/1MB).tostring("n2")+"MB" }},@{n="duration";e={$_.duration.totalseconds.tostring("n0")+"sec"}},
               @{n="Byes/Sec";e={($_.size/128/$_.duration.totalSeconds).tostring("n0")+"Kb/s"}},@{n="Encoding";e={($_.EncodingBitrate/1000).tostring("n0")+"Kb/s"}},
               @{n="Sample Rate";e={($_.sampleRate/1000).tostring("n1")+"KHz"}}
               Shows MP3 files with Artist and Track name, showing Size, duration, actual and encoding bits per second and sample rate
        .EXAMPLE
           Get-IndexedItem -path c:\ -recurse  -Filter cameramaker=pentax* -Property focallength | group focallength -no | sort -property @{e={[double]$_.name}}   
           Gets all the items which have a the camera maker set to pentax, anywhere on the C: driv
           but ONLY get thier focallength property, and return a sorted count of how many of each focal length there are.
